# Reinforcing some Kubernetes stuff and Kasten

## Cloud Research

- Spent the day prepping for our Kasten announcement which meant I went back and installed a local MicroK8s server and caught up quick on Kasten's latest releases. While we all don't have to be experts in Kubernetes and containers, having a good foundational understanding of the concepts that drive them is critical.
- As container adoption and usage continues to explode, Kubernetes-native backup is one of the most critical challenges faced by Kubernetes operators today. Kubernetes, the fastest-growing infrastructure platform, is quickly becoming the foundation for all applications, no matter where they might be deployed. Its ubiquitous nature has it on track to be the next enterprise platform of choice, joining the ranks of Linux and vSphere.
